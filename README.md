Data Visualization and Storytelling

The sales Dataset I used, I got it from Kaggle: amazon.csv

And the insights drawn from the visualizations are as follows: 

Ratings between 4.1 and 4.2 dominate the product count, indicating most products are perceived as above average in quality.

Computers & Accessories has the highest product count, suggesting a broader product range or inventory in this category.

User AHIKUJDUV4T6D... is the most active reviewer, contributing the highest number of reviews.

Electronics Home has the highest average discounted price, indicating premium-priced products with significant discounts.

A rating of 4.1 is the most common, making up 17.85% of all ratings, reinforcing the prevalence of slightly above-average ratings.
